# 1. Create a class Employee and then do the following
# • Create a data member to count the number of Employees
# • Create a constructor to initialize name, family, salary, department
# • Create a function to average salary
# • Create a Fulltime Employee class and it should inherit the properties of Employee class
# • Create the instances of Fulltime Employee class and Employee class and call their member functions.
Creates class of employee as Employee
Declared and initialized the constructor
Created function as avg_saal
Printed output the avg_saal
Created class of fulltime employee as Fulltime_Employee
and appended the details of employee in a list
Printed output of employee count


# 2. Numpy
# Using NumPy create random vector of size 20 having only float in the range 1-20.
# Then reshape the array to 4 by 5
# Then replace the max in each row by 0 (axis=1)
# (you can NOT implement it via for loop)

imported the numpy 
Created random vector of size 20 with floats between 1 and 20
Reshaped the vector to 4 by 5
Replaced the max in each row by 0
Printed output of mat
